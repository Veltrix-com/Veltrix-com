# S Venkat Rajaraman

## 👤 About Me

Security Engineer • Python • Vulnerability Research
- Crafting precision security tools—from packet capture to web vuln detection. Open to collaboration & new challenges.

> **Mission**: Build India's most technically rigorous and operationally elite Blue Team operation—starting from zero.

---

## ⚒️ Core Focus

- **Veltrix Vulnerability Scanner**  
  Architecting a modular, precision-first scanner combining packet capture, protocol/service fingerprinting, misconfiguration analysis, and web-layer vulnerability discovery.

- **Client-Driven Security Utilities**  
  Delivering practical tools with measurable impact—credential leak monitors, custom scrapers, and streamlined reconnaissance modules.

- **Engineering for Auditability**  
  Every line is built to be reliable, testable, and correct under stress. Functionality is mandatory; resilience is the standard.

## 🧠 Operating Philosophy

- **Precision Is Non-Negotiable**  
  Security isn’t forgiving. Every detail is deliberate and validated.

- **Brutal Clarity Over Progress Theater**  
  Work is either done right or it’s not done. No in-betweens.

- **Perfection = Predictability**  
  Perfection means consistent, testable, and verifiable behavior. Not gloss.

- **Impact > Aesthetics**  
  Code beauty is irrelevant if it doesn't protect. Output must serve real security needs.

## 🧭 Mental Models

- **Perfection = Stability**: *If it can’t be trusted blindly, it isn’t done.*
- **Skin in the Game**: *Tools must solve real risks or they're noise.*
- **Discipline > Motivation**: *Consistency is my edge.*
