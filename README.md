## 👤 About Me

I'm an 18-year-old cybersecurity builder based in India, focused on engineering **Veltrix**—a full-stack vulnerability assessment and threat analysis platform. My foundation in combat sports instills an uncompromising discipline in execution, and I bring the same intensity to security development.

> **Mission**: Build India's most technically rigorous and operationally elite Blue Team operation—starting from zero.

## ⚒️ Current Focus

- **Veltrix Vulnerability Scanner**  
  Architecting a modular, precision-focused scanner that combines packet capture, service fingerprinting, misconfiguration analysis, and web vulnerability detection.

- **Client-Centric Security Tools**  
  Creating tools that deliver direct business value—custom scrapers, credential leakage monitors, and lightweight reconnaissance utilities.

- **Security Engineering with Standards**  
  Perfection here is non-negotiable. I’m committed to building tools that are not just functional, but resilient, auditable, and accurate under pressure.

## 🧠 Operating Philosophy

- **Precision is Power**: In security, details aren't optional—they're everything.
- **Brutal Clarity**: I don’t romanticize progress. It’s either done right or it’s not done.
- **Perfection as Reliability**: I define perfection as consistent, testable, and correct behavior—not polish.
- **Client Value > Code Beauty**: Visuals come second. Insight and protection come first.
